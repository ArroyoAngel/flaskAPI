# DESCRIPTION TO SWAGGER
This is the sample mobile application server of Fin-Farm, a future fishmeat production company, based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. You can get more information on. In the first iteration of the app, we have added the main functionalities!
       - User Registration.
       - User Authentication.
       - Registration of hatcheries or pools.
       - Record of Activities.
       - Product Registration.
       Now you can help us improve the API by testing with the server endpoints.
       That way, over time, we can improve the API overall and expose some of the new features in OAS3.
